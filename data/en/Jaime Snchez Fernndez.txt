Jaime Sánchez Fernández (born 20 March 1973), known simply as Jaime, is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a defensive midfielder.


== Football career ==
Jaime was born in Madrid. After starting professionally with a modest team in the capital, RSD Alcalá (with which he achieved a 1992 promotion to Segunda División B), he joined Real Madrid, playing three seasons for its reserve sides.
Jaime first appeared in La Liga for Racing de Santander, on loan, being a mainstay during 1996–97 and subsequently returning home to help Madrid to the following campaign's UEFA Champions League, coming in the 82nd minute of their 1–0 win against Juventus F.C. and remaining two years with the club.
Subsequently Jaime signed for Deportivo de La Coruña and, prior to the team's signing of Aldo Duscher, would appear significantly in the 2000 league conquest, the first ever for the Galicians. However, it would be the only season he would play for Depor, being consecutively loaned for the duration of his link, including twice to German Bundesliga's Hannover 96.
Jaime retired in 2006 at the age of 33, after one-season stints with Albacete Balompié and Racing de Ferrol – the latter in Segunda División – with both spells ending in relegation.
