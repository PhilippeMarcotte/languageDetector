Makuv'a, also spelled Makua and also known as Lovaea (Lovaia), is an apparently extinct Austronesian language spoken at the northeast tip of East Timor near the town of Tutuala.
Makuv'a has been heavily influenced by neighboring East Timorese Papuan languages, to the extent that it was long thought to be a Papuan language. The ethnic population was 50 in 1981, but the younger generation uses Fataluku as their first or second language.
