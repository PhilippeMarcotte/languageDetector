LaTeXila is a TeX/LaTeX editor to edit TeX/LaTeX documents. It runs on Linux systems with the GTK+ library installed.


== Features ==
LaTeXila has many useful features needed to edit TeX/LaTeX source code, such as:
Customizable one-click buttons to build, view and convert documents
Auto-completion of (La)TeX commands
Graphical lists of symbols for easy insertion
Templates for new document creation
Project management
Summary of the document structure
Spell checking based on gspell
Forward and backward search to switch between the sources and the PDF
BibTeX integration
However, it lacks some features available in other editors:
Split screen (available in TeXShop, Vim-LaTeX (LaTeX-suite), TeXmacs...)
Compare (available in WinEdt, Vim-LaTeX (LaTeX-suite), TeXmacs...).
