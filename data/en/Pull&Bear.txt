It focuses on casual, laid-back clothing and accessories for young people with a very urban style, at accessible prices. The stores themselves are designed as vanguardist spaces that are attractive to their target market.
Heavy use of graphic elements and text on clothing, much of it referencing the United States or the United States popular culture. However the clothes are not sold in the US, nor delivered to the US if bought on-line.
