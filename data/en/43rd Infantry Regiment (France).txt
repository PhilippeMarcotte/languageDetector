The 43rd Infantry Regiment (French: 43e Régiment d'Infanterie or 43e RI) was a French infantry regiment which dated back to the creation in 1638 of the Régiment Royal des Vaisseaux - one of the regiments of the Maison militaire du roi de France (Royal Military House of France) created to serve on boats and in the colonies: all such regiments were, in 1791, given a number in the line-infantry order of battle meaning that they could be considered historically as the "ancestors" of the naval infantry regiments (see 107th Infantry Regiment (France)).

=== Between the Wars ===
There is no information in the book The 43rd R.I. the regiment of Lille


=== Second World War ===
In 1939–1940, constantly bombarded by enemy aircraft, the regiment moved to contact the German army in Belgium (fighting on the Dijle) leading to fierce fighting along the Scheldt (Bruille-Saint-Amand). The regiment then regrouped and fought at Dunkirk before being ordered to disarm in Normandy after losing 231 killed and 600 wounded.
Shortage of time nearly led to the loss of the regimental flag. On 21 June 1940 Colonel Gaillard decided, in the face of the German danger, to hide his flag in the basement of Le Mesnil-Rainfray rectory. The flag was returned at the end of the winter of 1941 by Lieutenant Mourgant and Sergeant Menet on the instructions of Lieutenant Vallat, formerly of the 43rd Infantry Regiment. The unit became the 43rd Alpine Infantry Regiment stationed in Marseille and Digne (one battalion). The regiment recovered the flag which was solemnly presented on 3 May 1941 before the unit was disbanded in 1942 after the invasion of Vichy France by the Germans. It was restored by the Maquis of Nord and Cher and ended the war on the front in the pockets of the Atlantic.

==== Indochina War ====
The regiment detached the Marching battalion of the 43rd Infantry Regiment between January 1947 and June 1948 and participated in particular in Operation Lea.
A citation for the Marching battalion of the 43rd Infantry regiment:
"An elite Regiment, a worthy heir of the Royal des Vaisseaux, presented themselves on their arrival in Indochina, faithful to the finest traditions of their forebears. Engaged for eight months in the sub-sector of Gia Lâm (Tonkin) they have carried out, under the fiery leadership of their chief - Commandant Lejosne, the conquest and pacification of a difficult area between the Canal des Rapides and the Red River. Called on to participate in the liberation of Hà Đông during the freeing of Nam Định, their cleaning-up operation north of the Rapids bridge won admiration for their energy, their offensive spirit which never shrank from the hardest sacrifices. On 14 May 1947, after a daring raid on the Red River, they seized Việt Trì. Engaged without a moment's rest in the autumn campaign, they once again demonstrated their bite. Placed in difficult conditions on the Claire River at Phu Doan, Lang-Quang, Tuyên Quang, and Sơn Dương, they coped magnificently. They inflicted heavy losses in men and material on the enemy. They are assuredly one of our best Units".


==== Algerian War ====
The regiment participated in operations in Morocco and in Algeria from 1952 to 1962 at the cost of 2 officers, 3 NCOs, and 57 men killed.
