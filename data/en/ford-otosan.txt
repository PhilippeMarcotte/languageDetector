Ford Otosan is an automotive manufacturing company based in Turkey, equally owned by Ford Motor Company and Koç Holding. It was established in its current form in 1977, with original relations dating back to 1928. It currently operates five facilities throughout the country, and is headquartered in Gölcük, with a second location in İnönü.


== History ==
The collaboration began in 1928, when Vehbi Koç was assigned as Ford dealer in Ankara. The following year, the Turkish national assembly granted to Ford the right to install a local assembly operation in a free zone located in Istanbul's port area. Limited amounts of vehicles were assembled there until 1934, when these activities were suspended.
In 1959, the foundation of the Otosan factory was held in Istanbul, and in 1960 the Ford Consul was the first model to be produced at the plant, followed by the Thames and the Thames Trader van. In 1965, the D1210 truck was added to production, and in 1966, the Anadol, the first mass-production passenger vehicle developed in Turkey. In 1967, the Ford Transit also began production and in 1973, the Anadol STC-16, the first sports car developed in Turkey.
In 1977, the company signed a license agreement with Ford and the company's name was changed to Ford Otosan. In 1979, took place the groundbreaking ceremony for a new factory in İnönü, Eskişehir, which began production of the Ford Cargo in 1983. Also that year, Ford increased its share of ownership in the company to 30 percent. In 1985, the Ford Taunus begins production at the Istanbul plant, and in 1986 the official opening ceremony for the İnönü engine plant is held.
In 1992, the newer Ford Transit was put into production, and in 1993 the Ford Escort replaced the Ford Taunus on the production lines. In 1997, Ford further increased its share in the company to 41 percent, becoming equal partner with Koç Holding in the joint venture. In 1998, the groundbreaking ceremony was held for the new factory in Gölcük, Kocaeli, that became operational in 2001, replacing the Istanbul facility. It is aimed mainly at commercial vehicle production, and manufactures the Ford Transit and the Ford Transit Connect, both models being marketed worldwide. In 2003, the company launched a new generation of the Ford Cargo heavy-duty truck.
In September 2012, Ford revealed its new version of the Transit, and in January 2013 the new Cargo heavy truck was unveiled. The latter was co-developed by Ford Otosan in partnership with Ford Brazil, and will be manufactured in both countries.
