P (named pee /ÀàpiÀê/ ) is the 16th letter of the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet.


== History ==


== Use in writing systems ==
In English orthography and most other European languages, ‚ü®p‚ü© represents the sound /p/.
A common digraph in English is ‚ü®ph‚ü©, which represents the sound /f/, and can be used to transliterate ‚ü®œÜ‚ü© phi in loanwords from Greek. In German, the digraph ‚ü®pf‚ü© is common, representing a labial affricate /pf/.
Most English words beginning with ‚ü®p‚ü© are of foreign origin, primarily French, Latin, Greek, and Slavic; these languages preserve Proto-Indo-European initial *p. Native English cognates of such words often start with ‚ü®f‚ü©, since English is a Germanic language and thus has undergone Grimm's law; a native English word with initial /p/ would reflect Proto-Indo-European initial *b, which is so rare that its existence as a phoneme is disputed.
However, native English words with non-initial ‚ü®p‚ü© are quite common; such words can come from either Kluge's law or the consonant cluster /sp/ (PIE *p has been preserved after s).
In the International Phonetic Alphabet, /p/ is used to represent the voiceless bilabial plosive.
