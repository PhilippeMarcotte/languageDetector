== History ==
The Crenshaw House, better known as "The Old Slave House", is located at Junction, near the intersection of Illinois Route 13 and Route 1. A mansion atop Hickory Hill, the house was built in 1842 by John Crenshaw, who employed black slaves to work the nearby saline wells. Crenshaw also operated an underground railroad in reverse, capturing free blacks and selling them into slavery. The house is believed by some to be haunted, and a number of journalists and thrill seekers have attempted to spend nights in the house. The house was operated as a privately owned tourist attraction for a time until 1996. The cramped slave quarters in the attic could be viewed. The state of Illinois purchased the site in 2000, and local activists hope to see it opened as a historical site. The salt springs can be visited. They are on state land along the south bank of the Saline River, just east of the bridge on Route 1.
The low-lying town has been plagued by Ohio River floods in 1937 and again in 1997.
The Island Riffle variety of watermelon is a popular crop in the area.
