=== 2002 World Circumnavigation ===
In 2002, Kevin and Julia Sanders broke the Guinness World Record for the fastest circumnavigation of the world by motorcycle, taking 12½ days off the previous record established by Nick Sanders in June 1997. They averaged 1,000 miles (1,600 km) each day on the bike and rode 19,461 miles (31,319 km) in 19 days 8 hours and 25 minutes. The bike used was a BMW R1150GS.
This motorcycle record also beat the existing car record for Around the World by 1 hour and 50 minutes, a record which allows two drivers to rotate the driving. Their Guinness World Record motorcycle ride now stands as the fastest overland vehicle around the world, although the Guinness World Records organisation no longer recognises such attempts.


=== 2003 Trans Americas ===
The previous record for the Trans Americas route had stood at 47½ days. The Sanders broke this by over 12 days, doing it in 35 days. The Trans Americas route covered almost 17,000 miles (27,000 km) of tough riding, rugged terrains and extreme weather conditions. They went from Deadhorse, Prudhoe Bay in Alaska to Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego, Argentina. The bike used was a BMW R1150GS Adventure. Guinness no longer certifies such rides.


== 2010 Silk Road East expedition ==
In April 2010 led a ten-week commercial expedition through Europe, Turkey, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and China. The 13,000-mile (21,000 km) trip ended in July 2010, with only one rider sent home due to altitude sickness en route to Everest Base Camp.


== Charity ==
Their rides have also raised money for SOS Children's Villages. With its UK base in Cambridge, their old home town, this charity cares for abandoned and orphaned children in over 122 countries worldwide. As part of their Trans Americas World Record, they managed to also visit the SOS Children's Village in Panama, whilst the bike was being air freighted to Caracas. Their total funds raised to date stand at almost £11,000 for the Trans Americas Guinness Ride. Sanders has also led other charity rides such as a 2006 trans-Russian expedition to raise money for the Royal Marsden Hospital.


== National Geographic Channel ==
National Geographic Channel broadcast a series, The Ride: Alaska to Patagonia, based on a 2005 trans-Americas ride undertaken by the Sanders and a team of eleven novice motorcycle overlanders. This ride traversed the Pan American Highway.
