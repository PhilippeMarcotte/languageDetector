State Road 537 was a short 1-mile (1.6 km) Florida State Road in Orange County, located entirely in Winter Garden. It is a commuter route of SR 535; the other commuter routes in Winter Garden are Colonial Drive and SR 438.
The southern terminus is SR 50, and the northern terminus is SR 438, with both ends of the state road extend into unsigned portions. South of SR 50, it becomes a 1.3-mile (2.1 km) street called Daniels Road, forming an overpass of the Florida's Turnpike and ending at CR 535. Beyond its northern terminus, it becomes a residential street that extends to the shore of Lake Apopka.
This road may have been decommissioned by the state in late 2009 because all signage indicating the road number has been removed.
