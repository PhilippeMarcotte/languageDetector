The 1952 United States presidential election in Minnesota took place on November 4, 1952 in Minnesota as part of the 1952 United States presidential election.
The Republican candidate, former Supreme Allied Commander Europe General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower won the state over Illinois governor Adlai Stevenson by a margin of 154,753 votes, or 11.22%. Eisenhower went on to win the election nationally, with 442 electoral votes and a commanding 10.9% lead over Stevenson in the popular vote.
Incumbent President Harry S. Truman was the last President who was unaffected by the term limit imposed under the 22nd Amendment, but decided as early as 1950 that he would not seek another term. Eisenhower was the first Republican presidential nominee to win Minnesota (which had otherwise normally been a Republican stronghold) since the Stock Market Crash of 1929, and the first Republican elected to the presidency since Herbert Hoover left office in 1933.
