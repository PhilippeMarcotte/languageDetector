== Career ==
In 2003, Vandervelde moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan where he began recording local bands and friends in his basement studio. When Fonic Records heard the demo Vandervelde recorded for indie-pop songstress Brie Stoner, the label signed Brie, pairing Vandervelde with ex-Wilco guitarist Jay Bennett to produce a debut at Bennett's Pieholden Studio in Chicago. After the album's release in 2004, Vandervelde began living at Piehoden, working with Bennett on solo work and other recording projects.
Living and working at Pieholden, Vandervelde began a writing and recording streak that would provide the bulk of the material on his debut solo record. During this fruitful period, Vandervlede played on the Jay Bennett albums Bigger than Blue and The Magnificent Defeat.
In 2007, Secretly Canadian Records released the first David Vandervelde solo album, The Moonstation House Band. Culled from the one-man band sessions at Bennett's studio, the album won praise for its winning melodies and dense arrangements. Vandervelde's sound drew comparisons to T-Rex.
Following its release, Vandervelde relocated to Brooklyn, New York. In 2008, he released his sophomore effort, Waiting for the Sunrise. In April 2008, he established a permanent home in Nashville, Tennessee
