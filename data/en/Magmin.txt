In the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game, the magmin, or "magman", is a mischievous, nasty little goblin-like elemental creature from the Elemental Plane of fire. A magmin resembles a goblin made out of molten magma and burning cinders. Parts of it are on fire. It is roughly 4 feet tall and 1 foot wide.


== Publication history ==
The magman first appeared in the first edition in the adventure module In the Dungeons of the Slave Lords (1981), and then appeared in the original Monster Manual II (1983).
The magman appeared in the second edition for the Planescape setting in the Planescape Campaign Setting boxed set (1994).
The magmin appeared in the third edition Monster Manual (2000), and in the 3.5 revised Monster Manual (2003). The magmin was presented as a player character race in Savage Species (2003).


== Characteristics and habits ==
The magmin lives primarily on the Elemental Plane, but can easily travel to the Material Plane by manifesting itself in fireplaces, stoves, forges, and other such places. It likes to frighten housewives, blacksmiths, and other people working at these places by drooling a drop of lava or setting fire to what they are working on, but rarely intends to cause more harm than that.
Despite not usually intending true harm, the magmin is still a powerful fighter. Its touch is very dangerous to those without resistance to fire, and it can cause small explosions from itself. It can bite, scratch and spit, all of which set fire to anything flammable they touch. They can set fire to clothing, make armor searing hot, and melt weapons. Magmins are not valiant fighters, however, and flee if injured.
Magmins speak Ignan.
They are neutral in alignment.
