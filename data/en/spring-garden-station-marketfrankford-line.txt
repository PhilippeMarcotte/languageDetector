Spring Garden station is a SEPTA rapid transit station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on the Market–Frankford Line. It is located above the corner of 2nd Street and Spring Garden Street in the Northern Liberties neighborhood. It is the final above-ground/outdoor stop for trains before heading into central Philadelphia.
Though SEPTA gives the address as being at 600 North Front Street, the actual location is the median of Interstate 95 over Spring Garden Street. It was built in 1977 when the Market-Frankford Line's tracks were moved to the median of newly extended Interstate 95 for a distance of about 1 mile and replaced the abandoned nearby Fairmount Avenue Station, which was built in 1922 and had been a Skip-Stop "B" station during rush hours. The new station is currently an "All-Stop" station and is nestled in between the northbound and southbound lanes of Interstate 95 between the highway's Girard Avenue and I-676 interchanges.
Passengers utilizing this station may access such nearby sites as Penn's Landing's Festival Pier, popular Delaware Avenue nightclubs, a branch of the Dave and Busters entertainment complex situated on the Delaware River, and a number of bars, restaurants, and shops in the nearby Northern Liberties neighborhood.
