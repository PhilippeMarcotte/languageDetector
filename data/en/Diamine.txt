A diamine is an amine with exactly two amino groups. Diamines are used as monomers to prepare polyamides, polyimides and polyureas. In terms of quantities produced, 1,6-diaminohexane, a precursor to Nylon 6-6, is most important, followed by ethylenediamine. Vicinal diamines (1,2-diamines) are a structural motif in many biological compounds and are used as ligands in organometallic chemistry 


== Aliphatic diamines ==


=== Linear aliphatic diamines ===
2 carbons: ethylenediamine (1,2-diaminoethane). Related derivatives include the N-alkylated compounds, 1,1-dimethylethylenediamine, 1,1-dimethylethylenediamine, ethambutol and TMEDA.
3 carbons: 1,3-diaminopropane (propane-1,3-diamine)
4 carbons: putrescine (butane-1,4-diamine)
5 carbons: cadaverine (pentane-1,5-diamine)
6 carbons: hexamethylenediamine (hexane-1,6-diamine)


=== Branched aliphatic diamines ===
Derivatives of ethylenediamine are prominent:
1,2-diaminopropane, which is chiral.
diphenylethylenediamine, which is C2-symmetric.
diaminocyclohexane, which is C2-symmetric.


=== Xylylenediamines ===
Xylylenediamines are classified as alkylamines since the amine is not directly attached to an aromatic ring.
o-xylylenediamine or OXD
m-xylylenediamine or MXD
p-xylylenediamine or PXD


== Aromatic diamines ==
Three phenylenediamines are known:
o-phenylenediamine or OPD
m-phenylenediamine or MPD
p-phenylenediamine or PPD. 2,5-Diaminotoluene is related to PPD but contains a methyl group on the ring.
Various N-methylated derivatives of the phenylenediamines are known:
dimethyl-4-phenylenediamine, a reagent.
N,N'-di-2-butyl-1,4-phenylenediamine, an antioxidant.
Examples with two aromatic rings include derivatives of biphenyl and naphthalene:
4,4'-diaminobiphenyl
1,8-diaminonaphthalene
