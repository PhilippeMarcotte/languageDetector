La Terrasse-sur-Dorlay is a commune in the Loire department in central France.
La Terrasse-sur-Dorlay takes its name from the Dorlay river, a tributary of the Gier, which flows through the commune. The Barrage du Dorlay, a dam on this river with storage capacity of 2,500,000 cubic metres (88,000,000 cu ft), is just upstream from the village.
