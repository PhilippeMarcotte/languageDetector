Simon W. Gerson (January 23, 1909 â€“ December 26, 2004), also known as Si Gerson, was a noted leader of the Communist Party USA. In particular, he was considered its leading expert on campaigns and election. He was perhaps most famous for being the party's appointee to fill the New York City Council vacancy left by the death of Peter Cacchione, but with the council refusing to seat him. He was also an editor for The Daily Worker.
Si Gerson was married to Sophie Melvin, a union organiser.
Gerson's papers were donated to the Tamiment Library after his death.
