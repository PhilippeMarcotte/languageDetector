Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Church (Serbian: Црква светог Саве; Crkva svetog Save) is a Serbian Orthodox church in Jackson, California. Built in 1894, the church was the first Serbian Orthodox church in America. Amador County had a large Serbian-American population in the late 1800s due to the California Gold Rush, and the county's Serbs established the St. Sava Church Organization of Amador County in 1886–87; the organization was responsible for purchasing land for and building the church. The church's original design had an Eastern Orthodox influence, complete with an onion dome; while the dome was later replaced by a bell tower, the church's stained glass windows and use of icons still give it a distinctive Eastern Orthodox character. The church has been used for Serbian-American religious and social activities since its opening and is now part of the Diocese of Western America.
The church was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 6, 1986.
