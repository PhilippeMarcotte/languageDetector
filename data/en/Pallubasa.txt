Pallubasa is the traditional food from Makassar, South Sulawesi. Like Coto Mangkasara (Coto Makassar), it is also made from offal of cattle or buffalo. The cooking process is same as for Coto Makassar; the offal is boiled for long time. After it is boiled, the offal is added to meat, then sliced and served in a bowl.
What distinguishes Pallubasa from Coto Makassar is its seasoning, which is specially formulated. Coto Makassar is eaten with ketupat, while Pallubasa is eaten with burasa.
