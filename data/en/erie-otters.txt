The Erie Otters are a Major junior ice hockey team based in Erie, Pennsylvania. They are members of the Midwest Division of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL), one of only three American teams in the circuit. The "Otters" name refers to the North American otter (Lontra canadensis), a semiaquatic mammal common to Lake Erie.


== History ==
The Erie Otters were previously located in Niagara Falls, Ontario, where they were called the Niagara Falls Thunder. They moved to Erie Insurance Arena in downtown Erie in time for the 1996–97 season. After three seasons of mediocrity in Erie, they won the Midwest Division's Holody Trophy in 1999. It was their first of three consecutive Midwest Division championships, culminating in a J. Ross Robertson Cup in the 2001–02 season. Additionally, Dave MacQueen won the Matt Leyden Trophy in 2000–01 as the OHL Coach of the Year and Sherwood Bassin was awarded OHL Executive of the Year for his role in building a championship team as general manager. The Erie Otters were the second U.S. team to win the OHL Championship, following the 1994–95 season champions Detroit Junior Red Wings (now the Plymouth Whalers).
Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine (LECOM) officially partnered with the Erie Otters in 2012 as their official medical provider.


== Connor McDavid era (2012-15) ==

Connor McDavid, a Canadian center, played for the Erie Otters from 2012 to 2015, before joining the Edmonton Oilers of the National Hockey League (NHL). The Otters chose him as their first overall pick in the OHL Priority Selection Draft. The NHL Central Scouting Bureau subsequently named McDavid the top North American prospect for the 2015 NHL Entry Draft, where the Oilers selected him first overall. The Greater Toronto Hockey League named McDavid "Player of the Year" for the 2011–12 season following a record of 79 goals and 130 assists. Hockey Canada, the governing body for amateur hockey in Canada, granted McDavid "Exceptional Player" status, which permitted him to play in the OHL a year earlier than would otherwise be permissible for a player his age. He was only the third player to receive that status, after John Tavares and Aaron Ekblad.


== Uniforms and logos ==
The Erie Otters' colors are navy blue, gold, red, and white. Their primary logo features a circular outline with a fierce, anthropomorphic otter furnishing a hockey stick and gear. The "Otters" wordmark is superimposed over the design in red with gold and navy blue outline. The team's home uniform includes a navy blue sweater with red and gold accents. The away uniforms feature a white jersey with navy blue and red trim.
For the 2013 season, the Erie Otters introduced a gold alternate jersey. This jersey features a navy blue shoulder yoke, navy blue and white stripes, and the cursive "Otters" wordmark centered across the chest. Its design resembles the sweaters of the defunct Erie Blades, who played from 1975 to 1982.


== Arena ==

The Erie Otters play their home games at Erie Insurance Arena, which opened in 1981 and currently seats 5,500 spectators. It is a centerpiece of the Erie Civic Center Complex, which also includes the Jerry Uht Park baseball stadium, home to the Double-A Erie SeaWolves.
