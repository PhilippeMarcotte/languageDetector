Glen Dean Chilton (born in 1958) is a Canadian-Australian scholar and author of humorous books on adventure travel and natural history.
Chilton is also an internationally recognised ornithologist and behavioural ecologist and is considered the world's leading authority on the extinct Labrador duck. His first book The Curse of the Labrador Duck was a finalist in 2010 for the Stephen Leacock Medal for Humor and the William Saroyan International Prize for Writing. His second book, Attack of the Killer Rhodondedrons (a.k.a. The Last Place You'd Look for a Wallaby) achieved the Queensland, Australia best-seller list in 2013.


== Biography ==
Born of British descent in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, Chilton moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba with his family in 1967. He received a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Science degree in zoology from the University of Manitoba, and a PhD in ornithology and behavioural ecology from the University of Calgary, Alberta. He was professor of biology and ornithology at St. Mary's University College, Calgary, Alberta until moving to Australia in 2008. He is currently adjunct at James Cook University in Townsville, Queensland, Australia and professor emeritus at St. Mary's University College.
Chilton's areas of expertise and scientific research include recent extinction events, particularly of bird species; the conservation of plant and animal species rediscovered after having been thought to be extinct; the impact of plant and animal species introduced into new geographic regions by humans; the cultural evolution and song dialects of songbirds; and the interactions between parasitic insects and their bird hosts.


== Travel writing ==

Chilton turned his classroom teaching into book writing when an effort to catalogue all remaining stuffed specimens of an extinct North American bird evolved into an obsessive journey around the world. Chilton describes himself as a travel and adventure enthusiast with a tongue-in-cheek sense of humour and a passion for sharing the natural world with his audience. His writing style has been compared to the likes of Bill Bryson, James Harriot, David Quammen, Redmond O'Hanlon and Farley Mowat.
On a quest to see all fifty-four stuffed Labrador duck specimens that remain in existence for his first book The Curse of the Labrador Duck, he travelled 72,018 miles by aircraft, 5,461 miles by train, 3,566 miles by car, 1,169 miles by bus and 43 miles by ferry. That distance is the equivalent of 3.3 times around the Earth. His second book, Attack of the Killer Rhodeodendrons (a.k.a. The Last Place You'd Look for a Wallaby), which examined plants and animal species that were introduced to foreign locations by humans, took him to six continents and fourteen countries
As of April 2014, Chilton was writing his third book, about plant and animal species that were thought to be extinct but have recently been rediscovered. In 2015 Chilton plans to paddle over 350 km by canoe and kayak down England's River Thames, from its source near Kemble, Gloucestershire to its end in the North Sea, for Falling Down the Thames, an adventure travel documentary about the human history and natural history of the Thames.
