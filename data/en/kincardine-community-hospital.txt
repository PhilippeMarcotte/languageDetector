Kincardine Community Hospital was opened in 1998 to serve the health needs of the local population in and around Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. It is operated in partnership with Care UK, a private health care provider.
Within the hospital there is a 19-bed GP acute admissions ward (Arduthie Ward), a 16-bed unit caring for frail elderly patients (Mearns Ward), two slow stream rehabilitation beds and a 12-bed unit specialising in care of elderly mentally infirm patients, with two of these beds used as a respite facility (Ardoe Ward).
Mowat Court Nursing Home with 16 beds is also situated within the buildings.
There is also a Minor Injuries Department with a telemedicine link to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary's Accident and Emergency Unit.
The Community Night Nursing Service and Rapid Response Service are based at Kincardine Community Hospital as is the Child Development Team for Kincardine.
NHS Grampian is planning a new satellite renal dialysis unit at the hospital and has agreed to pay £300,000 for equipment and staff if fundraisers cover the £500,000 building costs.
A befriending service was established at the hospital in 2013 matching older patients ready to be discharged, but lacking confidence to return home, with a volunteer befriender. The volunteers then visited them regularly in hospital and at home after discharge, offering on-going emotional and practical support. Local GPs reported the service had improved the overall health and wellbeing of their patients and reduced the number of medically unnecessary GP visits.
